# Create a Virtual Talking Friend in Python! 
Imagine having a virtual friend that repeats everything you say! You can create this virtual talking friend using just a few lines of Python code and the pyttsx3 library.

Requirements
Install Python on your system.
Install the pyttsx3 library to enable text-to-speech functionality.
Run the following command in your terminal to install pyttsx3:

pip install pyttsx3
Step 1: Python Code
Hereâ€™s the Python code to create your virtual talking friend:

import pyttsx3

Initialize the pyttsx3 engine
friend = pyttsx3.init()

Get input from the user
speech = input("Say Something: ")

Make the virtual friend say the input text
friend.say(speech)

Run the speech engine to output the text
friend.runAndWait()
Step 2: Running Your Virtual Talking Friend
Save the script as virtual_friend.py.
Run the script in your Python environment (e.g., PyCharm or the terminal).
Type something when prompted with Say Something: and listen as your virtual friend repeats what you said!

How It Works
Initialization: pyttsx3.init() initializes the text-to-speech engine.
Input: The input("Say Something: ") function prompts you to type something in the console.
Speech Output: friend.say(speech) tells the virtual friend to speak whatever you typed.
Execution: friend.runAndWait() processes the speech and makes your virtual friend say it aloud.
Customization Ideas
Voice Options: You can change the voice or rate of speech using friend.setProperty() to make your friend sound unique!
Looping: You can add a loop to keep the conversation going until you choose to stop.

Enjoy talking to your virtual friend! ðŸ˜Š
